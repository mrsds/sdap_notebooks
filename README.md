# sdap_notebooks
Jupyter notebooks to illustrate how to make calls to SDAP for
methane-related analytics.  You can click on the notebook file above and
Github should render it for you to view.

This is for illustrative purposes only and
cannot actually be run because the SDAP deployment it was based on has
been shut down.
